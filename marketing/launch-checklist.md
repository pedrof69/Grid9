## Response Templates

### For "Why not use [alternative]?"
"Great question! Grid9 specifically optimizes for the 9-character/3-meter sweet spot. [Alternative] is excellent for [their use case], but Grid9 shines when you need consistent 3m precision in minimal space."

### For "What about what3words?"
"what3words pioneered the 3m precision standard and deserves credit. Grid9 takes a different approach - pure coordinate math vs dictionary encoding - achieving the same precision in 53% less space."

### For bug reports:
"Thanks for finding this! I've opened issue #X to track it. Could you share your test case so I can reproduce?"

### For feature requests:
"Interesting idea! The current focus is on the core 9-character encoding, but I'm tracking enhancement requests in the GitHub issues."
